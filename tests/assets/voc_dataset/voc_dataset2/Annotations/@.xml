  <!--
    The purpose of this file is to test format detection in the case where
    at least one annotation file could be misdetected as being in the LabelMe
    format (due to containing no objects). See
    <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/datumaro/issues/658>.

    The name of the file is "@.xml" so that it's sorted before all other XML
    files and thus the LabelMe detector finds it first.
