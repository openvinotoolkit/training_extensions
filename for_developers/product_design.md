# Product Design

## Our Product Mission

1. **Provide a deep learning model training framework that encompasses various tasks solvable by deep learning models.** Our product aims to be convenient for developers, allowing them to easily expand support for tasks and models.

2. **Empower users to seamlessly and intuitively navigate the OpenVINO-based workflow, from model training to inference.** To ensure a user-friendly experience throughout, our product should have user-friendly CLI and Python API entrypoints.

3. **Support Intel devices for accelerating deep learning model training:** We offer best practices for training from scratch or fine-tuning popular model architectures using Intel devices.
