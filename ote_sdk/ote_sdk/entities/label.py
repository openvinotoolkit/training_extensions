    This represents a label. The Label is the object that the user annotates
    and the tasks predict.

    For example, a label with name "car" can be constructed as follows.

    >>> car = LabelEntity(name="car", domain=Domain.DETECTION)

    .. rubric:: About Empty Label

    In addition to representing the presence of a certain object, the label can also
    be used to represent the absence of objects in the image (or other media types).
    Such a label is referred to as empty label.
    The empty label is constructed as follows:

    >>> empty = LabelEntity(name="empty", domain=Domain.DETECTION, is_empty=True)

    Empty label is used to declare that there is nothing of interest inside this image.
    For example, let's assume a car detection project. During annotation process,
    for positive images (images with cars), the users are asked to annotate the images
    with bounding boxes with car label. However, when the user sees a negative image
    (no car), the user needs to annotate this image with an empty label.

    The empty label is particularly useful to distinguish images with no objects
    of interest from images that have not been annotated, especially in task-chain
    scenario. Let's assume car detection task that is followed with with another
    detection task which detects the driver inside the car. There are two issues here:

    1. The user can (intentionally or unintentionally) miss to annotate
        the driver inside a car.
    2. There is no driver inside the car.

    Without empty label, these two cases cannot be distinguished.
    This is why an empty label is introduced. The empty label makes an explicit
    distinction between missing annotations and "negative" images.

    :param name: the name of the label
    :param domain: the algorithm domain this label is associated to
    :param color: the color of the label (See :class:`Color`)
    :param hotkey: key or combination of keys to select this label in the UI
    :param creation_date: the date time of the label creation
    :param is_empty: set to True if the label is an empty label.
    :param id: the ID of the label. Set to ID() so that a new unique ID
        will be assigned upon saving. If the argument is None, it will be set to ID()
