Explanation
===========

This section consists of an algorithms explanation and describes additional features that are supported by OTX.
:ref:`Algorithms <algo_section_ref>` section includes a description of all supported algorithms:

1. Explanation of the task and main supervised training pipeline.
2. Description of the supported datasets formats for each task.
3. Available templates and models.
4. Incremental learning approach.
5. Semi-supervised and Self-supervised algorithms.
6. Additional algorithm-specific features such as a tiling method for Instance Segmentation and Rotated Object Detection.

:ref:`Additional Features <features_section_ref>` section consists of:

1. Overview of model optimization algorithms.
2. Hyper parameters optimization functionality (HPO).
3. Auto-configuration algorithm to select the most appropriate training pipeline for a given dataset.
