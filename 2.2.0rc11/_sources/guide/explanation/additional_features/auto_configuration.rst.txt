Auto-configuration for a deep learning framework means the automatic finding of the most appropriate settings for the training parameters, based on the dataset and the specific task at hand.
Auto-configuration can help to save time, it eases the process of interaction with OpenVINO™ Training Extensions and gives a better baseline for the given dataset.

At this end, we developed a simple auto-configuration functionality to ease the process of training and validation utilizing our framework.
Basically, to start the training and obtain a good baseline with the best trade-off between accuracy and speed we need to pass only a dataset in the right format without specifying anything else:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: API

        .. code-block:: python

            from otx.engine import Engine

            engine = Engine(data_root="<path_to_data_root>")
            engine.train()

    .. tab-item:: CLI

        .. code-block:: bash

            (otx) ...$ otx train ... --data_root <path_to_data_root>


After dataset preparation, the training will be started with the middle-sized recipe to achieve competitive accuracy preserving fast inference.


Supported dataset formats for each task:

- classification: `Imagenet <https://www.image-net.org/>`_, `COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_ (multi-label), :ref:`custom hierarchical <hierarchical_dataset>`
- object detection: `COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_, `Pascal-VOC <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/pascal_voc.html>`_, `YOLO <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/yolo.html>`_
- semantic segmentation: `Common Semantic Segmentation <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/common_semantic_segmentation.html>`_, `Pascal-VOC <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/pascal_voc.html>`_, `Cityscapes <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/cityscapes.html>`_, `ADE20k <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/ade20k2020.html>`_
- action classification: `CVAT <https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/xml_format/>`_
- action detection: `CVAT <https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/advanced/xml_format/>`_
- anomaly classification: `MVTec <https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad>`_
- anomaly detection: `MVTec <https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad>`_
- anomaly segmentation: `MVTec <https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad>`_
- instance segmentation: `COCO <https://cocodataset.org/#format-data>`_, `Pascal-VOC <https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/datumaro/stable/docs/data-formats/formats/pascal_voc.html>`_

If we have a dataset format occluded with other tasks, for example ``COCO`` format, we should directly emphasize the task type. If not, OpenVINO™ Training Extensions automatically chooses the task type that you might not intend:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: API

        .. code-block:: python

            from otx.engine import Engine

            engine = Engine(data_root="<path_to_data_root>", task="<TASK_TYPE>")
            engine.train()

    .. tab-item:: CLI

        .. code-block:: bash

            (otx) ...$ otx train --data_root <path_to_data_root>
                                 --task {MULTI_CLASS_CLS, MULTI_LABEL_CLS, H_LABEL_CLS, DETECTION, INSTANCE_SEGMENTATION, SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION, ACTION_CLASSIFICATION, ACTION_DETECTION, ACTION_SEGMENTATION, ANOMALY_CLASSIFICATION, ANOMALY_DETECTION, ANOMALY_SEGMENTATION, VISUAL_PROMPTING}
                                 ...

Auto-adapt batch size
---------------------

This feature adapts a batch size based on the current hardware environment.
There are two methods available for adapting the batch size.

1. Prevent GPU Out of Memory (`Safe` mode)

The first method checks if the current batch size is compatible with the available GPU devices.
Larger batch sizes consume more GPU memory for training. Therefore, the system verifies if training is possible with the current batch size.
If it's not feasible, the batch size is decreased to reduce GPU memory usage.
However, setting the batch size too low can slow down training.
To address this, the batch size is reduced to the maximum amount that could be run safely on the current GPU resource.
The learning rate is also adjusted based on the updated batch size accordingly.

To use this feature, add the following parameter:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: API

        .. code-block:: python

            from otx.engine import Engine

            engine = Engine(data_root="<path_to_data_root>")
            engine.train(adaptive_bs="Safe")

    .. tab-item:: CLI

        .. code-block:: bash

            (otx) ...$ otx train ...  --adaptive_bs Safe

2. Find the maximum executable batch size (`Full` mode)

The second method aims to find a possible large batch size that reduces the overall training time.
Increasing the batch size reduces the effective number of iterations required to sweep the whole dataset, thus speeds up the end-to-end training.
However, it does not search for the maximum batch size as it is not efficient and may require significantly more time without providing substantial acceleration compared to a large batch size.
Similar to the previous method, the learning rate is adjusted according to the updated batch size accordingly.

To use this feature, add the following parameter:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: API

        .. code-block:: python

            from otx.engine import Engine

            engine = Engine(data_root="<path_to_data_root>")
            engine.train(adaptive_bs="Full")

    .. tab-item:: CLI

        .. code-block:: bash

            (otx) ...$ otx train ...  --adaptive_bs Full


.. Warning::
    When using a fixed epoch, training with larger batch sizes is generally faster than with smaller batch sizes.
    However, if early stop is enabled, training with a lower batch size can finish early.


Auto-adapt num_workers
----------------------

This feature adapts the ``num_workers`` parameter based on the current hardware environment.
The ``num_workers`` parameter controls the number of subprocesses used for data loading during training.
While increasing ``num_workers`` can reduce data loading time, setting it too high can consume a significant amount of CPU memory.

To simplify the process of setting ``num_workers`` manually, this feature automatically determines the optimal value based on the current hardware status.

To use this feature, add the following parameter:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: API

        .. code-block:: python

            from otx.core.data.module import OTXDataModule

            datamodule = OTXDataModule(..., auto_num_workers=True)

    .. tab-item:: CLI

        .. code-block:: shell

            (otx) ...$ otx train ... --data.auto_num_workers True
