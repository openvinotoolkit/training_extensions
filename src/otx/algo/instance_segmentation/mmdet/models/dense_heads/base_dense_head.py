    1. The ``init_weights`` method is used to initialize densehead's
    model parameters. After detector initialization, ``init_weights``
    is triggered when ``detector.init_weights()`` is called externally.

    2. The ``loss`` method is used to calculate the loss of densehead,
    which includes two steps: (1) the densehead model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``loss_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to calculate the loss.

    loss(): forward() -> loss_by_feat()

    3. The ``predict`` method is used to predict detection results,
    which includes two steps: (1) the densehead model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``predict_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to predict detection results including
    post-processing.

    .. code:: text

    predict(): forward() -> predict_by_feat()

    4. The ``loss_and_predict`` method is used to return loss and detection
    results at the same time. It will call densehead's ``forward``,
    ``loss_by_feat`` and ``predict_by_feat`` methods in order.  If one-stage is
    used as RPN, the densehead needs to return both losses and predictions.
    This predictions is used as the proposal of roihead.
