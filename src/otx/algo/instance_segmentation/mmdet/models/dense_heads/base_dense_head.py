    model parameters. After detector initialization, ``init_weights``
    is triggered when ``detector.init_weights()`` is called externally.

    2. The ``loss`` method is used to calculate the loss of densehead,
    which includes two steps: (1) the densehead model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``loss_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to calculate the loss.

    loss(): forward() -> loss_by_feat()

    3. The ``predict`` method is used to predict detection results,
    which includes two steps: (1) the densehead model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``predict_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to predict detection results including
    post-processing.

    4. The ``loss_and_predict`` method is used to return loss and detection
    results at the same time. It will call densehead's ``forward``,
    ``loss_by_feat`` and ``predict_by_feat`` methods in order.  If one-stage is
    used as RPN, the densehead needs to return both losses and predictions.
    This predictions is used as the proposal of roihead.

            with_nms (bool): If True, do nms before return boxes.
                Default to True.
            img_meta (dict, optional): Image meta info. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            :obj:`InstanceData`: Detection results of each image
            after the post process.
            Each item usually contains following keys.

                - scores (Tensor): Classification scores, has a shape
                  (num_instance, )
                - labels (Tensor): Labels of bboxes, has a shape
                  (num_instances, ).
                - bboxes (Tensor): Has a shape (num_instances, 4),
                  the last dimension 4 arrange as (x1, y1, x2, y2).
