    - semi-positive integer: positive sample, index (0-based) of assigned gt

    Args:
        pos_iou_thr (float): IoU threshold for positive bboxes.
        neg_iou_thr (float or tuple): IoU threshold for negative bboxes.
        min_pos_iou (float): Minimum iou for a bbox to be considered as a
            positive bbox. Positive samples can have smaller IoU than
            pos_iou_thr due to the 4th step (assign max IoU sample to each gt).
            `min_pos_iou` is set to avoid assigning bboxes that have extremely
            small iou with GT as positive samples. It brings about 0.3 mAP
            improvements in 1x schedule but does not affect the performance of
            3x schedule. More comparisons can be found in
            `PR #7464 <https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/7464>`_.
        gt_max_assign_all (bool): Whether to assign all bboxes with the same
            highest overlap with some gt to that gt.
        ignore_iof_thr (float): IoF threshold for ignoring bboxes (if
            `gt_bboxes_ignore` is specified). Negative values mean not
            ignoring any bboxes.
        ignore_wrt_candidates (bool): Whether to compute the iof between
            `bboxes` and `gt_bboxes_ignore`, or the contrary.
        match_low_quality (bool): Whether to allow low quality matches. This is
            usually allowed for RPN and single stage detectors, but not allowed
            in the second stage. Details are demonstrated in Step 4.
        gpu_assign_thr (int): The upper bound of the number of GT for GPU
            assign. When the number of gt is above this threshold, will assign
            on CPU device. Negative values mean not assign on CPU.
        iou_calculator (dict): Config of overlaps Calculator.
        perm_repeat_gt_cfg (dict): Config of permute repeated gt bboxes.
