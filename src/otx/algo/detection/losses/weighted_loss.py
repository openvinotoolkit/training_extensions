    To use this decorator, the loss function must have the signature like
    `loss_func(pred, target, **kwargs)`. The function only needs to compute
    element-wise loss without any reduction. This decorator will add weight
    and reduction arguments to the function. The decorated function will have
    the signature like `loss_func(pred, target, weight=None, reduction='mean',
    avg_factor=None, **kwargs)`.
