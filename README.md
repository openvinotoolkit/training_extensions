## Overview

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions is a command-line interface (CLI) framework designed for low-code computer vision deep-learning model training. OpenVINO™ Training Extensions lets users train, infer, optimize and deploy models simply and fast even with low expertise in the deep learning field. OpenVINO™ Training Extensions offers a diverse combination of model architectures, learning methods, and training types using PyTorch and [OpenVINO™
toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit). OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provides so-called "model templates" for every supported task which have been tested on various datasets and are a turnkey solution for obtaining an average good model without the need to change any hyperparameters. Besides, it is possible to configure your own model based on [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html), [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), [pytorchcv](https://github.com/osmr/imgclsmob) and [OpenVINO Model Zoo (OMZ)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo). Moreover, OpenVINO™ Training Extensions supports auto-configuration functionality to choose a suitable model template based on the dataset. We will further extend our functionality to make training as much simple as possible for obtaining accurate, fast and light models ready to integrate into your projects.

To this end OpenVINO™ Training Extensions supports the following computer vision tasks:

- **Classification**, including multi-class, multi-label and hierarchical image classification tasks.
- **Object detection** including rotated bounding box support
- **Semantic segmentation**
- **Instance segmentation** including tiling algorithm support
- **Action recognition** including action classification and detection
- **Anomaly recognition tasks** including anomaly classification, detection and segmentation

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions also supports different training types:

- **Supervised**, incremental training including class incremental scenario and contrastive learning for classification and semantic segmentation tasks
- **Semi-supervised learning**
- **Self-supervised learning**

Moving forward, OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provides the following features:

- **Distributed training** to accelerate the training process when you have multiple GPUs
- **Half-precision training** to save GPUs memory and use larger batch sizes
- Integrated, efficient **hyper-parameter optimization module (HPO)**. Through dataset proxy and built-in hyper-parameter optimizer, you can get much faster hyper-parameter optimization compared to other off-the-shelf tools. The hyperparameter optimization is dynamically scheduled based on your resource budget.
- OpenVINO™ Training Extensions uses **[Datumaro](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/datumaro)** as the backend to hadle datasets. Thanks to that, OpenVINO™ Training Extensions supports the most common academic field dataset formats for each task. We constantly working to extend supported formats to give more freedom of datasets format choice.
- **Auto-configuration functionality**. OpenVINO™ Training Extensions analyzes provided dataset and chooses the proper task and model template to have the best accuracy/speed trade-off. It will also make a random auto-split of your dataset if there is no validation set provided.

## OpenVINO™ Training Extensions CLI Commands

- `otx find` helps you quickly find the best pre-configured models templates as well as a list of supported backbones
- `otx build` creates the workspace folder with all necessary components to start training. It can help you configure your own model with any supported backbone and even prepare a custom split for your dataset
- `otx train` actually starts training on your dataset
- `otx eval` runs evaluation of your trained model in PyTorch or OpenVINO™ IR format
- `otx optimize` runs an optimization algorithm to quantize and prune your deep learning model with help of [NNCF](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf) and [POT](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/pot_introduction.html) tools.
- `otx export` starts exporting your model to the OpenVINO™ IR format
- `otx deploy` outputs the exported model together with the self-contained python package, a demo application to port and infer it outside of this repository.
- `otx demo` allows one to apply a trained model on the custom data or the online footage from a web camera and see how it will work in a real-life scenario.
- `otx explain` runs explain algorithm on the provided data and outputs images with the saliency maps to show how your model makes predictions.
