# OTE CLI

**O**penVINO **T**raining **E**xtensions **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (OTE CLI), is the `ote` tool that contains set of commands needed to operate with deep learning models. Also there is an example how to work with deep learning models direclty from Python using OTE SDK Task interfaces.

## OTE CLI contents
### OTE Commands
* `ote find` - search for model templates.
* `ote train` - run training of a particular model template.
* `ote eval` - run evaluation of trained model on a particular dataset
* `ote export` - export trained model to the OpenVINO format in order to efficiently run it on Intel hardware.
* `ote demo` - run model inference on images, videos, webcam in order to see how it works on user's data.

### Jupyter nootebooks
* [Face detection nootebook](notebooks/train.ipynb) - demonstrates how to train, evaluate and export face detection model.
