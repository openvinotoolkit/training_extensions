        **MedPy** is a library and script collection for medical image processing in Python, providing basic functionalities for **reading**, **writing** and **manipulating** large images of **arbitrary dimensionality**.
        Its main contributions are n-dimensional versions of popular **image filters**, a collection of **image feature extractors**, ready to be used with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org), and an exhaustive n-dimensional **graph-cut** package.

        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev build-essential
        pip3 install medpy
        ```
        
        **MedPy** requires **Python 3** and officially supports Ubuntu as well as other Debian derivatives.
        For installation instructions on other operating systems see the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/).
        While the library itself is written purely in Python, the **graph-cut** extension comes in C++ and has it's own requirements. More details can be found in the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/).
        
        ### Using Python 2
        
        **Python 2** is no longer supported. But you can still use the older releases.
        
        ```bash
        pip install medpy==0.3.0
        ```
        
        ## Getting started with the library
        
        If you already have a medical image whose format is support (see the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/>) for details), then good.
        Otherwise, navigate to http://www.nitrc.org/projects/inia19, click on the *Download Now* button, unpack and look for the *inia19-t1.nii* file. Open it in your favorite medical image viewer (I personally fancy [itksnap](http://www.itksnap.org)) and beware: the INIA19 primate brain atlas.
        
        Load the image
        
        ```python
        from medpy.io import load
        image_data, image_header = load('/path/to/image.xxx')
        ```
        
        The data is stored in a numpy ndarray, the header is an object containing additional metadata, such as the voxel-spacing. Now lets take a look at some of the image metadata
        
        ```python
        image_data.shape
        ```
        
        `(168, 206, 128)`
        
        ```python
        image_data.dtype
        ```
        
        `dtype(float32)`
        
        And the header gives us
        
        ```python
        image_header.get_voxel_spacing()
        ```
        
        `(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`
        
        ```python
        image_header.get_offset()
        ```
        
        `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
        
        Now lets apply one of the **MedPy** filter, more exactly the [Otsu thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method), which can be used for automatic background removal
        
        ```python
        from medpy.filter import otsu
        threshold = otsu(image_data)
        output_data = image_data > threshold
        ```
        
        And save the binary image, marking the foreground
        
        ```python
        from medpy.io import save
        save(output_data, '/path/to/otsu.xxx', image_header)
        ```
        
        After taking a look at it, you might want to dive deeper with the tutorials found in the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/).
        
        ## Getting started with the scripts
        
        **MedPy** comes with a range of read-to-use commandline scripts, which are all prefixed by `medpy_`.
        To try these examples, first get an image as described in the previous section. Now call
        
        ```bash
        medpy_info.py /path/to/image.xxx
        ```
        
        will give you some details about the image. With
        
        ```bash
        medpy_diff.py /path/to/image1.xxx /path/to/image2.xxx
        ```
        
        you can compare two image. And
        
        ```bash
        medpy_anisotropic_diffusion.py /path/to/image.xxx /path/to/output.xxx
        ```
        
        lets you apply an edge preserving anisotropic diffusion filter. For a list of all scripts, see the [documentation](http://loli.github.io/medpy/).
        
        ## Read/write support for medical image formats
        
        MedPy relies on SimpleITK, which enables the power of ITK for image loading and saving.
        The supported image file formats should include at least the following. Note that not all might be supported by your machine.
        
        **Medical formats:**
