Fast Data Loading
=================

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provides several ways to boost model training speed,
one of which is fast data loading.

Caching

*****************
In-Memory Caching
*****************
OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provides in-memory caching for decoded images in main memory.
If the batch size is large, such as for classification tasks, or if dataset contains
high-resolution images, image decoding can account for a non-negligible overhead
in data pre-processing.
One can enable in-memory caching for maximizing GPU utilization and reducing model
training time in those cases.
