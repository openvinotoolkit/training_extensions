# mmdetection

## Introduction

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher. If you would like to use PyTorch 0.4.1,
please checkout to the [pytorch-0.4.1](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/pytorch-0.4.1) branch.

mmdetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the open-mmlab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  One can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different components.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **Efficient**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs now.
  The training speed is nearly 2x faster than Detectron and comparable to maskrcnn-benchmark.

- **State of the art**

  This was the codebase of the *MMDet* team, who won the [COCO Detection 2018 challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard).

Apart from mmdetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research,
which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.
